# Jasmine's little corner of the world

Hate building with pre-made tools, so decided to build my website from scratch. Never fails to get me locked in on a 3am code sesh even when I told myself I'd stop at 12.
Built in HTML/CSS. Nearly no JS. Pure design. Enjoying the purity of straight markup.
Please be kind and don't steal my designs. Thank you :)
