            <p>our primary target audience were <b>gen z students specifically around UCI</b> meaning that reaching them would require more <b>authenticity, personality, transparency, mixed with 
                promises of sustainability. </b>
                <br><br>
                I did a bit of research into the eating habits of Americans as well. These findings helped in <b>concentrating the website's message</b>, creating a 
                sense of <b>urgency</b> to purchase our products for the greater good AND for personal health (best of two worlds)
            </b></p>

            <p>my main takeaway was that broke college students must resort to unhealthy sources of nutrition due to time and money constarints (<a href="https://studyfinds.org/college-students-money-in-bank/#:~:text=The%20survey%20of%201%2C000%20U.S.,with%20no%20money%20in%20it.">60% of 
                college students have less than $1k in their pockets</a>) To remedy this, I focused the website on <b>accessibility, ease of use, and speed</b> so that busy students 
                can get the food they need in and out super fast.
                <br><br>
                <b>Our USP:</b> fast yet nutritious and delicious food tailored for university students. This was an idea I carried into the overall
                aesthetic and brand persona of Bonsai Bento.

            <br><br>
            <p>I spent a lot of time looking through <b>40-50 VE e-commerce websites</b> and seeing the common trends 
                to either avoid or follow (but do even better). I also analyzed a couple of cuisine startup websites and conglomerated
                the results here:

            </div>
            
            <p>overall, there seemed to be major neglect to most of the VE websites in terms of UI/UX. In terms of optimizing our website for 
                trade show use, I designed the check out process to be incredibly intuititve and guided so that the customer doesn't need to 
                overthink what to purchase. 
                <br><br>
                In addition, one of the other mahor advantages I found was incorporating a <b>unique personality</b> within our product through 
                visual cues. Most of the websites were soely focused on functionality but did not have a <b>unique selling point</b>. Since our 
                target audience values authenticity and brand incredibly high, I made sure to include more personal stories and tidbits about our 
                brand and production process throughout the website.

                    <p>My approach was to first gather initial thoughts and feelings from our student body (quasi user research) based on 
                        the business plan provided to us by the C-Suite. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Ideation:</b> The general design process was simplified; I started with basic <b>pen-on-paper ideation sketches</b> to map out the entire
                        flow of the website including the different pages included.

                    <p>As a graphic designer, my initial design process was UI/ aesthetics-centric rather than functionality. 
                        The key issues I adressed were with <b>accessibility and developing a meaningful and intuitive user flow</b>. 
                        This project got me thinking more about <b>systems design > graphic design</b>

                    <p>There were also a couple of issues with the intial design in the same vein of accesibility. I did a couple of <b>design audits 
                        and reviews</b> based on feedback from the CEO. I mainly redesigned the <b>information hierarchy</b> so that 
                        the user can purchase quickly without extra fluff in the process.

                        To acheive this, I designed 2 graphics: one at the beginning and the other at the end — combined, they tell the story 
                        of our brand in a <b>concise yet engaging manner.</b> Instead of centralizing the "mission statement" in one section, this creates 
                        a seamless and <b>journey-like user experience</b>.

                <br><br>
                One of the challenges I had was adding too many pcitures about our brand culture and not enough of the product.
                To remedy this, I added more pictures featuring <b>different POV's of our product</b> ALONG with our "top-notch customer service" (ie <b>human-centric images</b> - people still want to 
                see the "people" aspect of the company)

                    the entire UI approachable and familiar. To do this, I added small tidbits of personality through personalized, dyanmic graphics and

                                <li><b> A constant search for inspiration: </b> VE also exposed us to incredibly diverse fields (ex: I pitched a Bonsai Tree based video game, trade show wallet, and
                                Rainforest festival outside of Bonsai Bento) These projects helped me think iteratively and through design rather than pure execution — a good balance to
