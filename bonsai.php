                    <p>During my final year of high school, I decided to explore a new world of design combined with entrepreneurship: startups.
                        I joined the Virtual Enterprise Team on a whim, still unsure about what I wanted to do, I knew I wanted to explore more in 
                        the field of business + design ‚∏∫ luckily this was also the first time I was introduced to ui/ux design which is know one of 
                        my greatest passions.
                        <br><br>
                        As the Director of I.T. , I lead the end-to-end development of a <b>full-functioning e-commerce website for a Japanese Cullinary 
                        Startup headed by a group of students. I learned to use Figma to design high fidelity mockups before transfering my designs to the web.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        My biggest learning was through working with cross-sectional stakeholders on our team and building a website that matched our collective vision
                        for the company (tailoring the design to suit new product launches + seasonal marketing campaigns). Most of all, I found a new passion for the 
                        fast-paced environment of startups@

            <br>
            <p>Virtual Enterprise is a simulated, curricular business class for high school students seperating members into 5 different groups including
                design, marketing, and sales. My general responsibility was to develop a <b>usable digital platform for possible leads/cusotmers to easily access

            <p>How can we create an <b>accessible yet personable</b> experience for digitally-versed college students to buy delicious yet fast Japanese Cuisine? </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">

        <div class="subsub-title">Some Key Features</div>
        <br>
        <p>The goal was to make our website stand out visually yet have a flow that would be accessible and engaging. Here are the 
            ways I thought of acheving this:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>meaningful I.H.:</b>information and CTA presented strategically in order. Serial position effect </li>
                <li><b>a focus on persoanlity:</b> lots of mini interacetions and a larger focus on the <a href="https://tnnguyen161.wixsite.com/bonsai-bento/about-us" target="_blank">about us page</a> 
                    to bring the audeince closer to the origin story of our company (more personable + approachable)
                </li>
                <li><b>low barrier to entry:</b> guide the user through the step-by-step proccess of purchasing with visual cues.</li>
                <li><b>clarity and transparency:</b> detailed description pages for products including the production process and health benefits, leaving no questions asked by the customer</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        

        <div class="container">
            <hr class="solid">
        </div>
        <!-- user research -->
        <p style="opacity: 60%";><b>User Research</b></p>
        <div class="subsub-title">Understanding our Customers</div>
        <br><br>
        <p>our primary target audience were <b>gen z students specifically around UCI</b> meaning that reaching them would require more <b>authenticity, personality, transparency, mixed with 
            promises of sustainability. </b>
            <br><br>
            I did a bit of research into the eating habits of Americans as well. These findings helped in <b>concentrating the website's message</b>, creating a 
            sense of <b>urgency</b> to purchase our products for the greater good AND for personal health (best of two worlds)
        </b></p>
        <img src="images/bonsai bento stats.png" alt="">
        <p>my main takeaway was that broke college students must resort to unhealthy sources of nutrition due to time and money constarints (<a href="https://studyfinds.org/college-students-money-in-bank/#:~:text=The%20survey%20of%201%2C000%20U.S.,with%20no%20money%20in%20it.">60% of 
            college students have less than $1k in their pockets</a>) To remedy this, I focused the website on <b>accessibility, ease of use, and speed</b> so that busy students 
            can get the food they need in and out super fast.
            <br><br>
            <b>Our USP:</b> fast yet nutritious and delicious food tailored for university students. This was an idea I carried into the overall
            aesthetic and brand persona of Bonsai Bento.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>My approach was to first gather initial thoughts and feelings from our student body (quasi user research) based on 
                    the business plan provided to us by the C-Suite. 
                    <br><br>
                    The general design process was simplified: from basic pen-on-paper ideation to 
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>As a graphic designer, my initial design process was UI/ aesthetics-centric rather than functionality. 
                    The key issues I adressed were with <b>accessibility and developing a meaningful and intuitive user flow</b>. 
                    This project got me thinking more about <b>systems design > graphic design</b>
                </p>
                <img src="images/pain points bonsai bento text.png" alt="">
                <p>There were also a couple of issues with the intial design in the same vein of accesibility. I did a couple of <b>design audits 
                    and reviews</b> based on feedback from the CEO. I mainly redesigned the <b>information hierarchyt</b> so that 
                    the user can purchase quickly without extra fluff in the process.

                    C-Suite requests. <b>Working with cross-functional stakeholders helped me see past my limited view of design</b> and into the 
                    collaborative work it really was.

                            <li><b> Prioritizing Functionality:</b> after seeing dozens of designs from other VE companies, I noticed a common trend was the prioritization of
                            aesthetics over functionality. As a prev Graphic Designer, this revelation shifted my focus from aesthetics to user flow, functionality, and intuitive design
