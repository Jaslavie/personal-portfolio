            <p>my contrarian and not-so-contrarian beliefs.</p>
            <h1><span>Enduring value</span></h1>
            <p>History fascinates me. It's a lived experiment of humanity's attempt at creating longevity, and ultimately something 
              (a manuscript, empires, or entire governance systems) that outlives. 
              <br/><br>
              There is no natural reason to do this. Our animalistic instinct tells us to do things just to survive. 
              Yet in its midst, we have masters (be it da vinci, napoleon, or the like) that have a grudging, irrational desire
              to create a legacy that ripples beyond their generation. 
              <br/> <br/>
              This is a core ethos I want to bring into my work. I want to build systems that endure beyond myself: wether that 
              be software products, new human-ai collaboration frameworks, or hosting the first
              <a href="https://www.socratica.info/" target="_blank">crafter community</a> at uci.

           <div class="content-section">
            <h1><span>Mastery</span></h1>
            <p>My favorite book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X" target="_blank">Mastery</a>.
               In a culture that galvanizes prestige, quick wins, and flamboyant displays of accomplishment -- I firmly believe that
               the next era will elevate deep thinkers, masters of their field, and enduring systems (see point 1).
               <br/> <br/>
               We should promote commitment over optionality, specialism over generalism, focus over shallow achievement 
               -- all while maintaining our ethos over adaptability. My goal is to master the art of human experience, and right now 
               there is a gap between ai capability and user experience.

            <h1><span>Seriousness</span></h1>
            <p>Seriousness is deep engagement and caring about creating 
              <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-157587475" target="_blank">enduring value</a>.
              Katherine Boyle <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-34495925" target="_blank">comments</a> 
              on "shields of irony" that dull seriousness. 
              <br/><br/>
              I strongly believe that once you enter a venture,
              you should fully commit to it and treat it as your life's mission, even if it fails. 
              I don't treat work as a fun game to optimize. I don't believe in "playing hard, working hard". 
              What I work on is an extension of what I value and who I am. I want to cultivate this like a 
              garden, not a forest left to grow wild without care.

           <div class="content-section">
            <h1><span>Will to power</span></h1>
            <p>"Will to power" is a term coined by 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank">Nietzsche</a>, 
              describing an underlying drive and self-reliant
              force that powers all existence. I strongly believe in individual willpower and overcoming of 
              adversity to become exceptional.
              <br/><br/>
              I respect humanity's ability to get what it wants on its own behalf -- 
              out of pure self-driven willpower, skill, and execution without being muddled by shallow alliances
              and relationship-building (which is necessary, but ability to independently execute should come first).
              <br/><br/>
              I think that the only way we can assert our potential is to face challenges on our own without over-relying
              on pre-built scaffoldings. This pursuit 
              should be individualistic at its core -- grounded in an intuitive drive for self-expression and 
              obsessive commitment to excellence, achieved through pure willpower.

            <h1><span>Build the ladder, don't climb</span></h1>
            <p> 
              In school, we are conditioned to climb a pre-made corporate ladder. 
              Why not build our own and live on our own terms? 
              <br/><br/>
              This isn't about building a venture or business, but designing a life
              that deeply resonates with who you are. For me, that means spending less time grinding without purpose 
              and more time visiting art museums and sketching in my notebook. It means spending less time optimizing
              for summer, spring, and winter internships and more time iterating over a single project I care a lot about.
              It means <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-156802970" target="_blank">ditching</a> the "drop-out founder" and "swe intern" titles and focusing more on the legacy I am trying
              to build.

              <li>Your time estimates are always wrong. Always multiply your expectations by 2x at minimum. You always need more time than you think.</li>
              <li>Regret is an intoxicating force. It can either kill you or push you to prove yourself. Always choose the latter. </li>
              <li>Get really good at reading b.s. in people. this is often disguised as prestige and status. Cultivate awareness when people are putting up a front, but don’t try to fix it. <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/napoleon_bonaparte_103585" target="_blank">Never interrupt your enemy</a> when they’re making a mistake.</li>
              <li>You know much, much less than you think. You only realize this when you start surrounding yourself with the top 1%. Aim for this.</li>
              <li>Chasing achievement/quick wins is a losing game. Always aim for the long-term.</li>
              <li>Select close friends with the same criteria lvl of scrutiny as you’d use to eval a romantic partner. Ask: “would i be satisfied if i became them?”. Never exceed 3-4 close friends.</li>
              <li>Stick with your convictions ruthlessly. If the group does not align, leave rather than conform for the sake of harmony (there’s some nuance in this. the baseline of any opinioin should be a combo of intuition + reason).</li>
              <li>Sticking with habits means creating artificial routines for yourself: drink the same coffee, wear the same clothes, eat the same thing, run every morning. Most people are too flexible with this, you need to stick to this like military doctrine.</li>
