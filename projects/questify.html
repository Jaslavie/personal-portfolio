          <p>
            Entering my Freshman Year of University, I knew I wanted to get
            involved, but the <span> trade-offs</span> of joining one club over
            another were overwhelming. Getting involved in clubs is a pillar of
            university experience, but <span>barriers-to-entry</span>
            like the complexity of club discovery and academic pressure
            discourage students from finding their tribe.

            <p>
              These are common problems that
              <span>college students around the US</span> are experiencing.
              Clubs are a crucial part of university life for most students,
              both as a means to meet people and to advance one’s career.
              However, most clubs at UCI use incompatible systems: from
              <span>google forms to physical sign-in sheets</span>. Students are
              having trouble managing all these logistics across multiple clubs.

              Imagine you're a HS Senior who just got into your dream college.
              You’re excited to get involved but with
              <span>over 1,000 clubs</span> and move-in prep, you just don’t
              have time. You end up joining clubs that you’re not interested in
              and fall off in a month. What now? <br /><br />
              After digging deeper into the student life of other campuses, we
              found that public universities have a LOT of clubs. Students
              <a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w5go9p/is_joining_clubs_in_college_absolutely_necessary/"

              The current user flow between clubs and students isn’t consistent
              across clubs and leverages a lot of external softwares that
              <span>increases the barriers-to-entry</span> to participating in
              these clubs. <br /><br />
              To address the issue of lacking a centralized access point for
              club activities, <span>I mapped out the direct flow</span> between
              students and clubs. I also included the main input items (feedback
              and demographic data) that were not well centralized in clubs.

                interacting with clubs. Club executives, on the other hand, are
                more concerned with
                <span>member growth and resume building experiences</span>.
