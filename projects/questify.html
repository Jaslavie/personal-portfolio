            Organization involvement is one of the pillars of university
            experience. Even though a majority of students want to get more
            involved, common barriers-to-entry such as complex club discovery
            and academic pressure discourage students from getting involved.
            <br /><br />
            We wanted to experiment with the possibility of combining something
            familiar while encouraging more involvement. This is what me and 7
            other UCI students decided to explore gamification. Can we apply
            leverage this in a healthy way to improve a core aspect of a
            student’s experience?

            These are common problems that

            clubs at UCI use incompatible systems: from
            <span>google forms to physical sign-in sheets</span>. Students are
            having trouble managing all these logistics across multiple clubs.
